## How to Use

### For Developers - First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install browsers (one-time, ~500MB)
npx playwright install --with-deps

# 3. Run tests (requires WordPress instance)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm test
```

### For CI/CD - GitHub Actions
1. Go to repository **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
2. Add secret: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` with your test WordPress URL
3. Tests will run automatically on PRs

### For Debugging
```bash
# Interactive UI mode (recommended)
npm run test:ui

# Debug mode with Playwright Inspector
npm run test:debug

# View last test report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Next Steps for Contributors

1. **Set up a test WordPress instance** with the plugin installed
2. **Configure BASE_URL** environment variable or secret
3. **Run the setup verification tests** to ensure Playwright works
4. **Add more test cases** as new features are developed
5. **Review test reports** in GitHub Actions artifacts
