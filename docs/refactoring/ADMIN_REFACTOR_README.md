## 🎯 Goals

### Primary Goals
1. ✅ **Break down monolithic Admin Class**
   - From 1,197 lines → 5 focused classes (~250 lines each)
   
2. ✅ **Make it usable with proper functionality segregation**
   - Business metrics for owners
   - Technical details for developers
   - Health monitoring for operations
   - Debug info for troubleshooting

3. ✅ **Use live metrics - no stale or null status**

   - Live rate limiting
   - Current cache statistics
   - Fresh health checks

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Average class size <250 lines (max 450)
- [ ] >60% test coverage
- [ ] All metrics show live data
- [ ] No functionality lost
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
