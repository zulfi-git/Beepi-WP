# Codebase Assessment

## Overview
- **Project type:** WordPress plugin that exposes vehicle lookup functionality backed by a Cloudflare Worker.
- **Primary entry point:** `vehicle-lookup.php` bootstraps helper, data, API, caching, access control, WooCommerce integration, and multiple shortcode classes before wiring activation hooks and admin UI initialization.【F:vehicle-lookup.php†L1-L98】

## Architecture Highlights
- **Core orchestration:** `Vehicle_Lookup` coordinates database logging, remote API calls, caching, access checks, WooCommerce hooks, AJAX endpoints, and rewrite rules for `/sok/{reg}` routes. It also triggers asynchronous AI summary generation when cached vehicle data is reused.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup.php†L15-L175】
- **Remote services:** `VehicleLookupAPI` communicates with the Cloudflare Worker for immediate data, AI summary polling, and market listings, with structured error handling and correlation IDs for observability.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-api.php†L10-L188】
- **Caching:** `VehicleLookupCache` wraps WordPress transients, storing timestamps alongside payloads and exposing worker-side cache invalidation for full clears.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-cache.php†L7-L107】
- **Data persistence:** `Vehicle_Lookup_Database` provisions and maintains a `vehicle_lookup_logs` table, augmenting schema on upgrades and sanitizing inputs before inserts for analytics and quota tracking.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-database.php†L15-L200】
- **Admin experience:** `Vehicle_Lookup_Admin` adds dashboard/settings/analytics pages, registers configurable options (worker URL, timeout, rate limits, cache duration, daily quota, log retention), and exposes AJAX actions for diagnostics and cache management.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-admin.php†L5-L178】

## Frontend Experience
- `assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js` drives the lookup form UX: client-side validation for multiple Norwegian plate formats, result rendering with dynamic tags, cache freshness messaging, and graceful fallbacks for manufacturer logos loaded from carlogos.org.【F:assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js†L1-L178】
- The script cleans previous AI summary widgets before new requests, preventing UI duplication and surfacing cache state to the end user.【F:assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js†L49-L95】

## Strengths
- Clear separation of concerns between transport (`VehicleLookupAPI`), caching, persistence, and presentation layers.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup.php†L15-L175】【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-cache.php†L7-L107】
- Defensive error handling with structured worker responses, correlation IDs, and circuit breaker awareness enhances debuggability of upstream failures.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-api.php†L101-L188】
- Administrative tooling provides monitoring (quota usage, analytics) and operational controls (cache clearing, health checks) without manual database access.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-admin.php†L36-L200】

## Risks & Opportunities
- `flush_rewrite_rules()` runs on every request via `add_rewrite_rules`, which can be expensive; moving it to activation/deactivation hooks would reduce runtime overhead.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup.php†L57-L67】
- `Vehicle_Lookup_Admin::init_settings()` registers the `vehicle_lookup_rate_limit` option twice; consolidating to one call avoids redundant work and potential validation conflicts.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-admin.php†L75-L145】
- Manufacturer logos rely on hotlinking to an external CDN; consider local fallbacks or caching to mitigate third-party dependency failures.【F:assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js†L124-L138】

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Relocate rewrite-rule flushing to plugin activation/deactivation logic and ensure rewrite rules are added idempotently at runtime.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup.php†L57-L67】
2. Audit admin option registration for duplicates and align sanitization callbacks across settings to prevent drift.【F:includes/class-vehicle-lookup-admin.php†L75-L145】
3. Evaluate hosting manufacturer icon assets locally or through a cached proxy to avoid runtime failures when third-party assets are unavailable.【F:assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js†L124-L138】
