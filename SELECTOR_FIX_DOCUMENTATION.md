# Selector Fix for Listings Second Viewing Issue

## Problem Summary

Market listings and AI summaries were disappearing or flickering when viewing the same vehicle registration number multiple times (especially on second viewing with cached data).

## Root Cause Analysis

The polling detection logic in `assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js` used incorrect CSS selectors to check if content was already rendered:

### Issue 1: AI Summary Detection
- **Incorrect selector (lines 1279, 1287):** `.vehicle-overview`
- **Actual class created:** `.ai-section` (created by `renderAiSummary()` function at line ~1047)
- **Impact:** Polling system couldn't detect already-rendered AI summaries, causing them to be re-rendered on every poll

### Issue 2: Market Listings Detection
- **Incorrect selector (lines 1307, 1314):** `.market-listing`
- **Actual class created:** `.market-listing-item` (created by `renderMarketListings()` function at line 1407)
- **Impact:** Polling system couldn't detect already-rendered market listings, causing them to be re-rendered on every poll

## The Fix

### Changed Lines in `assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js`

#### Line 1279 (AI Summary - Complete Status)
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (!$('.ai-summary-section .ai-summary-content .vehicle-overview').length) {

// AFTER
if (!$('.ai-summary-section .ai-summary-content .ai-section').length) {
```

#### Line 1287 (AI Summary - Generating Status)
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (!$('.ai-summary-section .ai-summary-content .vehicle-overview').length) {

// AFTER
if (!$('.ai-summary-section .ai-summary-content .ai-section').length) {
```

#### Line 1307 (Market Listings - Complete Status)
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (!$('.market-listings-section .market-listings-content .market-listing').length) {

// AFTER
if (!$('.market-listings-section .market-listings-content .market-listing-item').length) {
```

#### Line 1314 (Market Listings - Generating Status)
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (!$('.market-listings-section .market-listings-content .market-listing').length) {

// AFTER
if (!$('.market-listings-section .market-listings-content .market-listing-item').length) {
```

## How The Fix Works

### Before the Fix
1. User searches for vehicle (e.g., "CO10003")
2. Initial API call returns data with status "generating"
3. Polling starts, checking every 2 seconds
4. When data becomes "complete", polling tries to check if content exists
5. Selector doesn't match actual DOM elements (`.vehicle-overview` vs `.ai-section`)
6. Polling thinks content isn't rendered yet
7. Content gets re-rendered on EVERY poll response
8. This causes flickering, duplication, or disappearing content

### After the Fix
1. User searches for vehicle (e.g., "CO10003")
2. Initial API call returns data with status "generating"
3. Polling starts, checking every 2 seconds
4. When data becomes "complete", polling checks if content exists
5. Selector correctly matches actual DOM elements (`.ai-section`, `.market-listing-item`)
6. Polling detects content is already rendered
7. Content is NOT re-rendered unnecessarily
8. ✅ Smooth, flicker-free experience with persistent content

## Verification

All verification checks passed:

```
✅ Old selectors removed from code
✅ New selectors present in correct locations
✅ CSS files confirm the correct classes exist
✅ JavaScript syntax is valid
✅ 4/4 verification checks passed
```

### Files Verified
- `assets/js/vehicle-lookup.js` - JavaScript logic updated
- `assets/css/market.css` - Contains `.market-listing-item` definition
- `assets/css/responsive.css` - Contains responsive styles for `.market-listing-item`
- `assets/css/vehicle-lookup.css` - Contains `.ai-section` definition

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open the vehicle lookup page
2. Search for a vehicle (e.g., "CO10003")
3. Wait for AI summary and market listings to load
4. Search for the SAME vehicle again (cached response)
5. Verify listings appear immediately without flickering
6. Check browser console - should see logs like:
   ```
   ✅ AI summary generated successfully
   ✅ Market listings generated successfully
   ```
7. No duplicate rendering should occur

### Automated Test
A test HTML file is available at `/tmp/test-selector-fix.html` that validates:
- New selectors correctly find rendered content
- Old selectors don't find anything (as expected)
- Polling logic correctly prevents re-rendering

## Impact

### Before
- ❌ Content flickering on second viewing
- ❌ Duplicate rendering on every poll
- ❌ Poor user experience with unstable UI
- ❌ Unnecessary DOM manipulation overhead

### After
- ✅ Stable content display
- ✅ Content rendered only once
- ✅ Smooth, professional user experience
- ✅ Optimized performance with minimal DOM operations
